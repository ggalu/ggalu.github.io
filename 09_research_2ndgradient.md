# A novel 2nd gradient metamaterial

Structured materials can exhibit mechanical properties that are unattainable in materials governed solely by their chemical composition. In some cases, conventional continuum models, such as the Cauchy continuum theory, must be extended to accurately describe the deformation behavior of certain metamaterials.
To explore this, we designed the **pantographic orthoblock** (see Figure 1), based on a unit cell composed of slender rods connected by pivots. These pivots enable deformations primarily driven by the bending of the rods. By incorporating second gradients of displacement into the continuum model, the pantographic orthoblock became the first three-dimensional metamaterial where higher-order gradient effects are the dominant deformation mechanism.
Generalized continuum theories, however, require specialized numerical methods due to the presence of additional degrees of freedom or the need to account for higher gradients, which demand more complex solution spaces. To address this, we developed a Finite Element routine based on **Isogeometric Analysis**, enabling the computation of deformation fields with well-defined second derivatives throughout the structure.
Additionally, the orthoblock demonstrates a large elastic range and exhibits semi-auxetic behavior (see Figure 2).
The pantographic orthoblock exemplifies the limitations of the traditional Cauchy continuum theory. To design and accurately describe truly novel metamaterials, more generalized and advanced theoretical frameworks are essential.
