Special features of the system include the choice of detector between a flat panel with 124 µm pixel pitch and a CCD with 9 µm pixel pitch, mechanical precision positioning of the sample sample, automatic scanning processes and a variety of measurement protocols, including e.g. laminography.It is suitable for analyzing a wide range of materials and components, from small electronic electronic components, additively manufactured materials and larger industrial components. components. In-situ tensile and compression tests are possible in this system using a Deben CT5000 loadcell. Specimens with a diameter of between 5 to 20 mm can be subjected to forces up to 5 kN.custom-built high-resolution dedicated in-situ CTA system with an identical 160 kV nano-focus X-ray tube was developed and put into operation in collaboration with the Freiburg Materials Research Institute (FMF, Prof. Dr. Michael Fiederle). This system has an open load frame designed for this purpose. Compared to the Deben load frame, this enables a higher magnification factor and therefore a higher resolution for scans under load. Other advantages of the open system include improved accessibility and flexibility in sample placement as well as the ability to simulate various load scenarios under realistic conditions. A range of detectors including a conventional CMOS flat panel and photon-counting energy-sensitive techologies are available.

      "content": "A novel 2nd gradient metamaterialStructured materials can exhibit mechanical properties that are unattainable in materials governed solely by their chemical composition. In some cases, conventional continuum models, such as the Cauchy continuum theory, must be extended to accurately describe the deformation behavior of certain metamaterials.To explore this, we designed the pantographic orthoblock (see Figure 1), based on a unit cell composed of slender rods connected by pivots. These pivots enable deformations primarily driven by the bending of the rods. By incorporating second gradients of displacement into the continuum model, the pantographic orthoblock became the first three-dimensional metamaterial where higher-order gradient effects are the dominant deformation mechanism.Generalized continuum theories, however, require specialized numerical methods due to the presence of additional degrees of freedom or the need to account for higher gradients, which demand more complex solution spaces. To address this, we developed a Finite Element routine based on Isogeometric Analysis, enabling the computation of deformation fields with well-defined second derivatives throughout the structure.Additionally, the orthoblock demonstrates a large elastic range and exhibits semi-auxetic behavior (see Figure 2).The pantographic orthoblock exemplifies the limitations of the traditional Cauchy continuum theory. To design and accurately describe truly novel metamaterials, more generalized and advanced theoretical frameworks are essential.

      "content": "Visualising Ductile Failure with Ultra-High-Speed X-Ray ImagingThe aim of this research topic is to shed light on the ductile failure mechanism of metals. The ductile failure model rests on the assumption that shear and tensile strains nucleate voids which grow under subsequent deformation to form pores. Failure is understood as the interaction of pores, leading to a macroscopic crack. Our research interest is to directly measure the time-dependent evolution of void nucleation and pore growth in-situ, i.e. directly during an experiment.To this end, tensile tests at low and high strain rates are perfomted using High-Speed X-ray Phase Contrast Imaging (XPCI) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF).This approach enables real-time, high-resolution visualization of void nucleation, growth, and coalescence,providing valuable insights into the effects of strain rate on void dynamics. Radiographic images from in-situ testing, shown in Figure 1, reveal distinct behavior depending on the applied strain rate.Initially, small pores are visible in both conditions. Quasi-static tests display gradual void nucleation and growth,while dynamic tests exhibit rapid nucleation, growth, and coalescence within a short time frame.To analyze these processes, segmented X-ray images were used to track individual voids over time with aPoint-In-Polygon (PIP) test and a Euclidean Distance-based approach (ED). The Moving Least Squares (MLS) method was applied to determine local strain distributions around voids. Figure 2 illustrates the evolution of apparent void fraction with longitudinal strain. At low strain rates, void fraction increases steadily through isolated growth. In contrast, high strain rates show slow initial growth, transitioning to rapid coalescence beyond a critical strain, resulting in extensive internal damage.                              Figure 1: radiographic image showing the evolution of voids under tensile strain.

      "content": "Programming strain rate sensitivity into metamaterialsThis research explores the feasibility of programming time-dependent damping behaviour into metamaterials, an attribute typically considered as an inherent material property. To date, the design of mechanical metamaterials has been focused almost exclusively on time-independent or quasi-static properties. Designing time-dependent mechanical properties is still a relatively unexplored field. However, it is precisely here, where a considerable need for advanced materials, e.g., for crash and impact protection, can be fulfilled. Instead of relying on the intrinsic time-dependence of a given material, one would like to prescribe it in the design phase, along with its shape and other quasi-static properties. To address the gap, we propose a friction-based unit cell mechanism (see Fig. 1) that results in strain rate sensitive behaviour, independent of the base material’s property. Friction is a time-dependent phenomena and we rely on friction to obtain strain rate sensitivity. The magnitude of the friction force is controlled by the geometry of the curved beams. Parametric optimization of the unit cell geometry, combined with the surface morphology of the sliding interfaces, is key to exploiting friction properties and achieving programmable strain rate sensitivity.                              Unit cell design along with its key geometrical features. The vertical compressive load is redirected into displacement of the curved beams in horizontal direction, u. The central stems are pressed against each other creating contact pressure, thereby affecting the friction force.

We combine experimental and numerical approaches and investigate in particular these topics:- strain rate effects using Split-Hopkinson Methods- understanding, characterizing, and designing mechanical metamaterials- employing in-situ X-Ray CT and Digital Volume Correlation methods to characterize materials- developing meshfree methods for extreme deformation simulations- ecological and economic technology assessment![Tensile Test](/images/research/M8L8.png){: height=\"200\" }![Symmpact](/images/research/Symmpact.png){: height=\"200\" }![Collission Welding](/images/research/welding.png){: height=\"200\" }![Sustainability Analysis](/images/research/Sustainability.jpeg){: height=\"200\" }",
