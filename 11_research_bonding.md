# The effect of pressure and temperature on the strength and creep behaviour of sintered silver

To improve the reliability of power electronics, we are collaborating with Dr. Mohammad A. Gharaibeh from The Hashemite University to study sintered silver, an eco-friendly alternative to traditional lead-based solder.

In a project funded by DFG, the project addresses a critical gap in understanding how the manufacturing process influences the material's structural integrity. Current research efforts elucidate the effect of sintering conditions, including pressure and temperature, on the creep behaviour and the loading rate sensitivity of this bonding method. By combining CT imaging with tensile testing, this research aims to establish a clear link between the material's microstructure and its mechanical properties. The findings will provide valuable insights for the electronic packaging industry, ultimately leading to more durable and reliable power electronics.
