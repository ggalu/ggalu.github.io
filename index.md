# Research

Our group specializes in mechanical behaviour of materials. We combine experimental and numerical approaches and investigate in particular these topics:

- strain rate effects using Split-Hopkinson Methods
- understanding, characterizing, and designing mechanical metamaterials
- employing in-situ X-Ray CT and Digital Volume Correlation methods to characterize materials
- developing meshfree methods for extreme deformation simulations
- ecological and economic technology assessment
